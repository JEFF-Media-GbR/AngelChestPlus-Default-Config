# You can blacklist certain items from being put into the AngelChest.
# All blacklisted items will not be touched by AngelChest. They will
# behave just like they would normally do on death.
#
# You can define items by material, lore and/or name.
# You MUST use the "string list" format for the lore.
# Each line of lore is checked separately. All specified
# lines must match the item, but it's no problem if the
# item has additional lines.
# An item is only blacklisted if ALL specified options match.
# See below for examples.
#
# Available options:
#
#   material: <material> (e.g. DIAMOND_AXE, DIRT, or ANY)
#
#   loreContains:        (the item must include every defined line)
#     - "part of any line"
#     - "part of another line"
#
#   loreExact:           (the item must include every defined line)
#     - "exact text of any line"
#     - "exact text of another line"
#
#   nameContains: <part of custom item name>
#
#   nameExact: <exact custom item name> (e.g. "Â§cMy awesome sword")
#
#   ignoreColors: <true|false> (whether name and lore checks also check for color codes)
#
# Use '&' for color codes. If you set ignoreColors to false, do NOT add the color code.
# If you want to see the exact name and lore values for an item that you hold in your hand,
# enter "/acd blacklist" to get information about the current item.
# If you wish to copy that text, you can also run it from console like this: "/acd blacklist <player>"
# Note: You MUST rename this file to blacklist.yml if you wish to use it.
